# tidybox

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

tidybox is a collection of additions to dplyr and other tidyverse
libraries that are useful to me, so they could be useful to others.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidybox from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pedrovictori/tidybox")
```

## Example

Will be added at a later date.
